					<p class="body">Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on 5 May 1949 Arluk (Arlook) now lives in Arviat. Arluk has also lived in Baker Lake, Rankin Inlet, Chesterfield Inlet, Winnipeg and Churchill Manitoba. The fourth child of a family of seven he was the only one of his siblings to become a sculptor full time. His brother, Charlie Panigoniak, would also carve but would choose music as his form of artistic expression, becoming a popular singer-songwriter in the Canadian North. While Arluk&#8217;s late father, Sevuoi Aiyarani, did carve Arluk took it upon himself to learn carving at the age of nine. His early works are influenced by the abstract approach to sculpting found in the work of Tiktak, Kavik and John Pangnark that Arluk was exposed to while he lived in Rankin Inlet from 1956 to 1975. His first sculpture sold for less than a dollar in 1960. Arluk adds antler parts to his soapstone sculptures, protruding in intricate formations. He is known for carving a variety of stone including the hard stone of Keewatin, soapstone (steatite) and pipestone (catlinite). Arluk uses hacksaws and wood rasps, a hammer and a hatchet to create his sculptures. Characterized by soft curves Arluk&#8217;s sculpted animals, such as caribou and his favourite the musk-ox, interact with Inuit figures as well as stand alone. His sculptures are also populated by hunters, spirits, mother and child pairings, and grouped figures, whose &#8216;abstracted compositions of gently curving forms, undulate rhythmically&#8217;. His work is felt to be typical of the Keewatin region in that Arluk&#8217;s sculptures of figures have &#8217;abbreviated facial features&#8217; along with anatomical detailing. Growing beyond the influence of other sculptors by the mid-1970s Arluk&#8217;s individual style is apparent in his &#8217;semi-abstract&#8217;, complex, and interwoven compositions. Arluk&#8217;s individuality also shines through in his unique interpretation of form. Arluk&#8217;s work has been described as &#8216;sleekly modern&#8217; and similar in style to that of Henry Moore&#8217;s sculptures. Arluk is considered to be one of the most prominent artists of the Keewatin region. Arluk&#8217;s work has been shown in numerous group exhibitions. His first solo exhibition was held at the University of Alberta in 1969, and he has since been exhibited at the Canadian Guild of Crafts, Quebec, the Inuit Galerie in Mannheim, Germany, among many other venues. His work is represented in most major public collections across Canada.</p>

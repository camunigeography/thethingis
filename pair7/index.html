					<p class="body">The carving &#8216;Thinking of Flying&#8217; by Inuit artist George Arluk is paired here with a vertebra from the University Museum of Zoology&#8217;s iconic finback whale skeleton.<p /><p class="body">The most obvious connection between these pieces is the material, even though the two bones are dissimilar in appearance. There are vertebrae from the Zoology whale which resemble the cervical vertebra used by Arluk for the upper part of his sculpture, but they are far too large to fit in our case. The piece on display, although much larger than Arluk&#8217;s carving, is a relatively small vertebra from the Zoology specimen.<p /><p class="body">The objects reflect different perspectives on material, depending on artistic or scientific use. Arluk uses a found object, relic whalebone washed up and weathered on the shores of Hudson Bay: the vertebra in its own right is the substance of a work of art. Zoology&#8217;s whalebone is not usually exhibited except as part of an entire skeleton, a scientific specimen used to illustrate mammalian anatomy. Both perspectives, however, give the objects value in museum terms: things to be looked at and studied.<p /><p class="body">In fact, the Zoology bone was also washed up, on the South coast of England in 1885. The rarity of this event, as well as the size of the whale, brought hordes of curious visitors. As targets of a hunt, whales were central to industry in Victorian England, and remain vital to Inuit life. Neither culture, however, has traditionally had any use for found whale bone. Curiously, in both cases, it is the prospect of exhibition that has given these otherwise worthless items value. Placing these pieces side by side enables us to explore the history and cultural significance of whales in British and Inuit culture.<p/>

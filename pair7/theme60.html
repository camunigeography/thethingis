					<h3 class="black">Inuit Art</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					<p class="body">Inuit art, as with many other forms of graphic print art and sculpture, is visually immediate and therefore an accessible entry point to art in the general sense, even for audiences for who have had no previous opportunity to engage with art. It taps into a rich vein of oral and graphic description of the social and historical contexts of production. Inuit art, as any contemporary art, is both deeply reflective of tradition as well as a response to a rapidly changing world. The artists respond to environments in which external economic and political influences play as great a part as climate change in crafting a visual language of participation within a contemporary culture and the gaze of a modern audience.<p /><p class="body">Traditionally, the Inuit were dependent on the hunting of whales, walrus, seals and caribou, as well as fishing. They shared certain cultural elements, such as the kayak and umiaq (both types of boat), dog sleds, toggling harpoon heads, the ulu (woman&#8217;s knife), seal oil lamps, and double-layer skin clothing, as well as certain hunting and fishing techniques, and some religious beliefs and practices. All of these are now represented in the SPRI collection through their art, whether from the historical contact or contemporary periods, including clothing, artefacts such as snow goggles made from caribou antler and tools used to make clothing. However, there were considerable differences between cultures. Not all Inuit lived in snow houses, even seasonally, for example. This common stereotype was mainly informed by the accounts of explorers, who, in their search for a Northwest Passage, came into contact with Canadian Inuit. Today, there are about 130,000 indigenous people living in the North American Arctic. In Canada (Nunavut) and Greenland, they have attained some degree of self-government. In Alaska, Native corporations hold much economic and political power.<p /><p class="body">Contemporary Inuit art emerged in the late 1940s through the agency of committed individuals such as James Houston (1921–2005), a Canadian artist, designer, children&#8217;s author and film-maker who played an important role in the recognition of Inuit art and introduced printmaking to the Inuit. The Inuit named him &#8220;Saumik,&#8221; which means &#8220;the left-handed one.&#8221; Inspired by this interest and support, Inuit artists threw themselves into a creative passion, producing a stunning array of work and they have continued to refine and develop their art over the past 60 years. Inuit art has been a small but distinctive feature of the art scene in Britain since it was first shown as part of the Coronation celebrations by the Gimpel Fils Gallery in 1953, and has had a continuous presence since, now represented by the Narwhal Inuit Art Gallery in London. During that same period many public domain museums around Britain have either held touring exhibitions of Inuit art or acquired small collections. <p /><p class="body">The most significant of these collections is probably that held by the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. SPRI&#8217;s Polar Museum is unique in Britain in representing historical exploration, travel and science in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Although it had acquired artefacts and early historical objects from Arctic peoples, it was only as recently as 1966 that a significant collection of contemporary Inuit art objects and some graphics were displayed at the museum, solely as a result of a donation made by the late Charles Gimpel.<p /><p class="body">The small but significant range of Inuit artworks already held in the collection at SPRI included sculptures and works on paper, dating from the early days of Inuit art, although many were by unnamed artists. Particularly as a result of the Charles Gimpel donation, many prominent artists including Akeeaktashuk, Davidee Itulu, Kapik Kolola, Kopperkoolik, Shuvigar, Kaka Ashoona, Lucy Qinnuayuak, Parr and Pitseolak Ashoona are represented within the collection, as well as more recent works by the younger generation of artists.</p>

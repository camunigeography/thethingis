				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					<p class="body">The Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology&#8217;s current exhibition, <span class="italicise">Magic and Memory: Paul Montague in New Caledonia</span> (9 September &#8211; 23 February) forms part of an international research project called <span class="italicise">Pacific Presences</span>, which explores major, but largely unstudied, ethnographic collections from the Pacific that entered European museums during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<p /><p class="body">As part of the <span class="italicise">Pacific Presences</span> project, Kanak researchers are visiting Cambridge to examine Montague&#8217;s collection and to read his notes and journals. Their work adds new layers of information and interpretation to the collection and reveals that Montague&#8217;s fears that Kanak culture would not endure were unfounded. These contemporary encounters with Montague create new ways of remembering him and remind us that memory is an active, creative process that &#8211; while concerned with the past &#8211; happens in the present.<p /><p class="body">Rediscovering Montague&#8217;s collection and researching his story raises questions about how individuals and communities deal with loss, memory and remembrance. Is memory mutable or persistent?  Fluid or fixed?  Do new acts of remembering such as this exhibition recreate the past or help reshape it?<p /><p class="body">We know that Montague&#8217;s mother Amy spent the rest of her life trying to establish where Montague was buried. In the year after his death, she wrote to Professor Harmer, keeper of Zoology at the Natural History Museum: &#8216;In losing him I feel I have lost all I ever hoped for or set my heart upon&#8217;. In Cambridge, his mentor and pioneer of anthropology, Alfred Cort Haddon also mourned Montague&#8217;s loss. He also wrote to Harmer asking &#8216;Did you know Paul Montague? He was a most charming and talented boy. I anticipated a distinguished career for him&#8217;.<p /><p class="body">Montague&#8217;s story reflects the layers of loss experienced by millions of families across Europe and the Empire as well as the intellectual impoverishment suffered within many academic institutions. In this context, Montague takes his place within the familiar history of the War&#8217;s &#8216;Lost Generation&#8217; and the national narrative of loss we call &#8216;Remembrance&#8217;. The centenary of the start of the First World War offers an opportunity to revisit and review the ways in which we remember and engage with the events of 1914&#8211;1918. Despite an abundance of public memorials (there are 100,000 in the UK), it seems that we still struggle to know how to remember World War One. Individual stories provide a kaleidoscopic lens through which the many dimensions of the war can be better understood. By focusing on the life of Paul Denys Montague we are able to make connections that help reconcile the personal and the professional; the familial and the national; the near and the far; the past and the present. Despite its global and overwhelming significance, the War, when remembered through the lens of individual human experience, brings an immediate and intimate perspective; a perspective that resonates today.<p /><p class="body">Dr Julie Adams<br />Senior Research Associate<br />Pacific Presences Project<br />Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology</p>

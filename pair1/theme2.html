				<div class="col-sm-10">
					<p class="body">Born in Devon in 1890, Paul Denys Montague came from a family of collectors. His father was a renowned archaeologist, whose collection of Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts is now in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter. Montague attended the progressive boarding school Bedales, which encouraged simple living and an appreciation of the great outdoors through a regime of camping trips, cold baths and vegetarian food. Montague developed a love of nature and was a talented artist and musician. In 1909, he came to Cambridge to study zoology and became well known for his musical abilities, regularly appearing in concerts and recitals. His social circle included Virginia Stephen [later Woolf], Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and the poet Rupert Brooke.<p /><p class="body">In 1913, Montague undertook an expedition to the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia, with a fellow Cambridge graduate, the botanist R. H. Compton. Together they spent a year exploring the islands and collecting zoological and botanical specimens. Montague and Compton thought little of walking fifty miles in a day, clambering up mountains in search of particular specimens and lugging heavy equipment across rugged terrain. Montague recorded their exploits in his journal and through his writing we see his growing interest in Kanak culture. The journal contains drawings of Kanak objects and information about how they were used as well as descriptions of local traditions and even the notes of Kanak songs. Montague was particularly intrigued by the so-called &#8216;magic stones&#8217; which played a fundamental part in all aspects of Kanak life &#8211; from success in growing crops to sexual attractiveness, strength in battle and good health. He collected many examples, carefully labelling each one to indicate his understanding of its particular purpose and wrote extensively about their power and significance.<p /><p class="body">While Montague was away in New Caledonia, War had broken out in Europe. After his return to Cambridge, Montague joined the fight for King and Country and became a commissioned officer in the Army in November 1915. The following year, Montague began training as a pilot in the fledgling Royal Flying Corps and &#8211; aware of the dangers &#8211; wrote to his sister: &#8216;don&#8217;t tell my fond parents about the flying corps. One must do something nowadays.&#8217;<p /><p class="body">After completing his training in Egypt, Montague was posted to 47 Squadron which was serving in the Salonika Campaign, fighting against Bulgarian, German and Austrian forces. Conditions on the aerodrome were especially harsh &#8211; heat, flies and mosquitoes plagued the troops and disease was rampant. Nevertheless, Montague managed to find time between flying operations to pursue his love of the natural world. As one of his fellow airmen wrote: &#8216;he could usually be found embedded in the thatched roof of some local cottage... A tug on his boots and he would emerge, grimy, but grasping a clutch of eggs.&#8217; As a result of such exploits, Montague became known as &#8216;The Bird Man of Salonika&#8217;. The types of aircraft operated by the Royal Flying Corps in Salonika were judged by one contemporary as &#8216;wholly unsuitable for aerial combat.&#8217; And, in an age before parachutes were readily available, &#8216;death was an ever-present risk.&#8217; When Montague led a formation of five aircraft on a bombing raid over the Doiran front on 29 October 1917, that ever present risk became a tragic reality. Although the mission was completed successfully, Montague&#8217;s plane was attacked and was last seen spinning out of control. Three months later a photograph was dropped from an enemy plane over a British-held aerodrome with a note explaining that the pilot on the stretcher had been shot down and killed and was buried in an unmarked grave.<p /><p class="body">The site of Montague&#8217;s grave has never been located.</p>

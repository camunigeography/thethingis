					<p class="body">This pairing brings together magic stones from New Caledonia, collected by Paul Denys Montague in 1914, and a set of geological specimens collected by Peter Clarkson in the Transantarctic Mountains. Paul Montague was a Cambridge zoologist and friend of Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes and Rupert Brooke. He died in combat whilst serving with the Royal Flying Corps in Salonika in 1914. Peter Clarkson was a geologist with the British Antarctic Survey before moving to the Scott Polar Research Institute as the Executive Secretary of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).<p /><p class="body">These two sets of stones, unmodified and seemingly unremarkable, offer insights into the kinds of value humans give to objects and the motivations which drive field collection, a practice central both to anthropological and scientific research.<p /><p class="body">The &#8216;magic stones&#8217; of New Caledonia&#8217;s Kanak people were pebbles carefully selected for their power to influence all aspects of life, from hunting and agriculture to love and death. The arrival of Christianity in New Caledonia had already driven many Kanaks away from belief in their potency, which meant that Montague could collect examples. The stones gained a new significance as part of Montague&#8217;s collection, passing from the status of magical object to anthropological evidence with which Montague hoped to record a culture he feared was dying. Clarkson&#8217;s specimens, on the other hand, come from Antarctica, a continent with no indigenous human inhabitants. These rocks became significant through the process of collection itself, as geological specimens integral to furthering scientific understanding of the Antarctic continent.<p /><p class="body">Both sets of objects are not self-evidently meaningful, but are specifically defined and given significance by their labels. They highlight the ways in which we project value, religious or scientific, onto our surroundings. At the same time, they shed light on the status of objects in museums, redefined as part of specific collections. They are dependent on the stories recorded by their collectors to make them remarkable, which distinguish them from mere stuff or rubbish.<p/>

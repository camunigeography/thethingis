					<p class="body">Paul Montague and the poet Rupert Brooke were part of the same circle of friends at Cambridge. Brooke&#8217;s famous poem Dining Room Tea was written at Montague&#8217;s family home, when Brooke and a group of companions called in and had afternoon tea with Montague&#8217;s family while camping in the area.<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">Dining Room Tea – Rupert Brooke</span><p /><p class="body">When you were there, and you, and you,<br />Happiness crowned the night; I too,<br />Laughing and looking, one of all,<br />I watched the quivering lamplight fall<br />On plate and flowers and pouring tea<br />And cup and cloth; and they and we<br />Flung all the dancing moments by<br />With jest and glitter. Lip and eye<br />Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,<br />Improvident, unmemoried;<br />And fitfully and like a flame<br />The light of laughter went and came.<br />Proud in their careless transience moved<br />The changing faces that I loved.<p /><p class="body">Till suddenly, and otherwhence,<br />I looked upon your innocence.<br />For lifted clear and still and strange<br />From the dark woven flow of change<br />Under a vast and starless sky<br />I saw the immortal moment lie.<br />One instant I, an instant, knew<br />As God knows all. And it and you<br />I, above Time, oh, blind! could see<br />In witless immortality.<br />I saw the marble cup; the tea,<br />Hung on the air, an amber stream;<br />I saw the fire&#8217;s unglittering gleam,<br />The painted flame, the frozen smoke.<br />No more the flooding lamplight broke<br />On flying eyes and lips and hair;<br />But lay, but slept unbroken there,<br />On stiller flesh, and body breathless,<br />And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,<br />And words on which no silence grew.<br />Light was more alive than you.<br />For suddenly, and otherwhence,<br />I looked on your magnificence.<br />I saw the stillness and the light,<br />And you, august, immortal, white,<br />Holy and strange; and every glint<br />Posture and jest and thought and tint<br />Freed from the mask of transiency,<br />Triumphant in eternity,<br />Immote, immortal.<br /><span class="text-space">Dazed at length</span><p /><p class="body">Human eyes grew, mortal strength<br />Wearied; and Time began to creep.<br />Change closed about me like a sleep.<br />Light glinted on the eyes I loved.<br />The cup was filled. The bodies moved.<br />The drifting petal came to ground.<br />The laughter chimed its perfect round.<br />The broken syllable was ended.<br />And I, so certain and so friended,<br />How could I cloud, or how distress,<br />The heaven of your unconsciousness?<br />Or shake at Time&#8217;s sufficient spell,<br />Stammering of lights unutterable?<br />The eternal holiness of you,<br />The timeless end, you never knew,<br />The peace that lay, the light that shone.<br />You never knew that I had gone<br />A million miles away, and stayed<br />A million years. The laughter played<br />Unbroken round me; and the jest<br />Flashed on. And we that knew the best<br />Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.<br />I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,<br />And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,<br />When you were there, and you, and you.</p>

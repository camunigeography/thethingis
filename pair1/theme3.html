					<p class="body">Peter Clarkson developed an early interest in the polar regions. As a schoolboy he followed the progress of Sir Vivian Fuchs Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1955&#8211;58). He graduated from Durham University in 1967 and joined the British Antarctic Survey as a geologist. He spent the 1968 and 1969 austral winters at Halley Bay station on the Brunt Ice Shelf, Coats Land, Antarctica, and was Base Commander for the second winter. He carried out geological mapping in the Shackleton Range (80°S, 25°W) during the 1968&#8211;69 and 1969&#8211;70 austral summers before returning to the Department of Geology at Birmingham University to write up the work. He returned to Antarctica to do further summer field work in the Shackleton Range (1970&#8211;71), South Shetland Islands (1974&#8211;75), Shackleton Range (1977&#8211;78), and Antarctic Peninsula (1986&#8211;87). He was awarded the Polar Medal in 1976 and received a PhD from Birmingham in 1977.<p /><p class="body">In 1989 he left the British Antarctic Survey to take up the position of Executive Secretary of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), based in the Scott Polar Research Institute. SCAR is an international organization that "initiates, promotes and coordinates scientific research in the Antarctic and provides scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty System". His work took him to meetings all over the world, but not to Antarctica!<p /><p class="body">He has now retired and takes occasional Antarctic refresher courses on cruise ships to the Antarctic Peninsula, where he lectures on a variety of Antarctic subjects. He has written numerous scientific and general articles about the Antarctic, contributed Antarctic articles to travel books and two encyclopaedias, and has written a book on volcanoes. Most recently he has written, with David Walton, a history of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). He is a total enthusiast for all things Antarctic and will talk endlessly about his passion to anyone prepared to listen. He currently assists with the Scott Polar Research Institute&#8217;s education and outreach activities, giving talks and lectures to various school and adult groups.</p>

These veins are commonly quartz but may also contain other minerals, in this case a copper mineral. When copper minerals are weathered the resulting mineral is often blue or green in colour, rather like the colour of a copper roof.'

The tent was turned into a hospital for the day and you can see Tony True and Peter Clarkson applying the Plaster of Paris bandages and splints to the patient&#8217;s leg.'

This particular fold is on the headland on the south side of the entrance to Stromness Bay. It is sometimes called the &#8216;Shackleton Fold&#8217; because Sir Ernest Shackleton recognized it when he crossed the island in 1916 so he knew that he was coming down to the whaling station in Stromness Bay where he would be able to find help from the whalers for the rest of his party stranded on Elephant Island.'

				data-description='When I was about 15 years old I saw this picture in a geology textbook in the school library. I was already very interested in Antarctica and I thought the face of this mountain, rising vertically for 800 m (2600 ft) from the snowfield, was amazing. However, what really fascinated me about this picture was the last line of the caption where, to illustrate the scale of the face, it read &#8220;The arrow shows the dog team.&#8221; The reproduction of this picture is not brilliant here but even on the photograph in the book you had to look carefully to see the arrow, let alone the dog team. The mountain is part of the Sør Rondane range in Dronning Maud land. I was lucky enough to have a trip to Dronning Maud Land in 2004 but it is a large place and I still have not seen Birger Bergersenfjellet. It is still on my bucket list of places to visit, so who knows? I may be lucky!'

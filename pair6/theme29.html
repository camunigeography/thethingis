					<p class="body">Unicornu Fossile-Canstadiense: Fragments of a Mammoth Tusk<br />Pieces of fossil mammoth tusk were sent to Dr Woodward by two of his correspondents Johan Jakob Scheuchzer (1672&#8211;1733) and &#8216;M. Valkenier&#8217; (probably Pieter Valkenier (1641&#8211;1712)) and described as &#8220;Unicornu Fossile-Canstadiense&#8221; (fossil unicorn of Konstanz).<p /><p class="body">The fragments come from Bad Cannstatt near Stuttgart in Germany. These and the accompanying mammoth tooth may all have come from a famous excavation that took place there in 1701.<p /><p class="body">Fossil mammoth tusks were often identified as unicornu verum (true unicorn) as they were believed by some to be the horns of unicorns, a type of mythical beast. Unicornu verum was an expensive medicine that was used to counter poisoning and venomous bites and to cure wounds. Woodward&#8217;s more down to earth identification is &#8216;Pieces of large tooth&#8217;.<p /><p class="body">Johan Jakob Scheuchzer was a physician based in Zurich, and was famous for his &#8216;Homo diluvii testis&#8217; a fossil giant salamander he thought was the skeleton of a human killed during the biblical flood.<br /> <br />This mammoth tooth accompanied the Unicornu Fossile-Canstadiense fragments. The tooth is a molar from the right lower jaw of a mammoth, a type of extinct elephant. It was found at Bad Cannstatt near Stuttgart in Germany. Woodward describes the specimen as &#8216;A very large Grinder of some cetaceous Fish&#8217; by which he means the tooth of a whale.<p /><p class="body">Woodward&#8217;s collection and his published catalogue demonstrates that he was highly skilled at correctly identifying fossils. However, his failure to correctly identify this tooth as belonging to a type of elephant suggests that he had not been able to make detailed anatomical studies of the bones and teeth of living elephants and whales.<p /><p class="body">Dan Pemberton, Collections Manager, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences.</p>

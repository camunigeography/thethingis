					<p class="body">In Victorian England, when the Museum of Zoology&#8217;s finback whale washed up on a beach on the South coast, preserving the bones for close attention was not especially high on the list of priorities. Whales were seen as an almost inexhaustible resource: their blubber was essential for producing the oil that lit cities and homes, went into the production of soap, and lubricated machinery; their bones and baleen were used in the manufacture of corsets and umbrellas; their flesh was stripped (or flensed) and thrown back into the sea.<p /><p class="body">Although humans have been hunting whales for thousands of years for food and fuel, the history of commercial whaling really begins in the twelfth century, when Basque fisherman first began chasing whales in the Bay of Biscay. By the sixteenth century, they had found their way to the New World, and in the seventeenth century British and Dutch ships began to sail North towards Spitsbergen in pursuit of whales. American whaling, focused mainly on the Sperm whale, began in the eighteenth century from the island of Nantucket. This industry formed the subject of Herman Melville&#8217;s Moby Dick (1851) and it was on American sperm whaling voyages that the vast majority of scrimshaw was produced.<p /><p class="body">In the nineteenth century, whalers moved into the Pacific and discovered rich Arctic pickings in the Bering Straight. By the mid-eighteen hundreds there were close to a thousand commercial whaling vessels active worldwide. In 1904, the establishment of whaling stations on South Georgia made Antarctic whaling possible and the development of technologies such as the explosive harpoon meant that whales were killed in ever greater numbers: two million between 1920 and 1970, driving several species to the brink of extinction. In 1986, the International Whaling Commission issued a global moratorium on commercial whaling to enable populations to recover: this still stands, although several nations find ways to continue the pursuit.</p>

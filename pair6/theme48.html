					<p class="body">Scrimshaw is the name given to the wide variety of objects made or decorated by people involved with the whaling industry, and also to the process of making them. There is a variety of spellings and the origin of the word is disputed. Scrimshaw was an occupational pastime, the earliest examples made of baleen (whalebone) from Arctic whaling in the 17th century, but it continued in an almost unbroken tradition through Antarctic whaling in the present century. However, most scrimshaw was done on sperm whaling voyages between ca. 1835 and 1870, as the long cruises required to produce a full cargo provided the most opportunities for pastimes such as scrimshaw. New Englanders dominated this industry, so most scrimshaw has American associations and is held in collections in the U.S.A.<p /><p class="body">Scrimshaw materials were generally the sea mammal products which the men readily encountered. Various ivories from teeth and tusks (especially walrus), baleen (whalebone) and skeletal bone were used, perhaps with wood, horn, metal and even shells, to make a huge variety of useful and decorative things. However, most common were the teeth of sperm whales (whale ivory), decorated with pictorial scribework resembling engraving.<p /><p class="body">Most of the great whales are members of the cetacean order Mysticeti, the baleen whales. They feed off coastal banks and ice edges, consuming small organisms: plankton, krill or fish which they strain from sea water through plates of baleen. In the days of sail and the hand-held harpoon the main quarry were the three large species of Right whales: the Arctic Right whale (Greenland whale or Bowhead, Balaena mysticetus) and two other species of Right whales: the Atlantic (Balaena/Eubalaena glacialis) and the Southern (Balaena/Eubalaena australis). The main catch of modern whalers in the present century was another group of large baleen whales, the rorquals, most of them species of Balaenoptera.<p /><p class="body">The sperm whale (Physeter catodon/macrocephalus) is the only great whale in the order Odontoceti, the large group of toothed whales which includes porpoises and dolphins. Sperm whales, which prefer warm deep oceans, were not exploited until the early 18th century. Sperm whaling became the major industry for Yankee whalers although a small but significant London-based fleet in developed from the late 18th century, and later fleets were established in Australia and New Zealand. Sperm oil proved superior to whale oil (from baleen whales) as a lamp oil and was also non-drying and viscostatic and thus an excellent lubricant. The head chamber of this whale also contains spermaceti wax which made the finest candles.<p /><p class="body">Sperm whales develop some 23 pairs of large, roughly conical ivory teeth in the mandible which fit into sockets in the upper jaw. After extraction from the tough gum the teeth were filed or scraped smooth and carefully polished with shark skin, pumice or wood ash. The chosen design could be drawn or traced on to the surface. Some pictures were copied by pricking the surface of the tooth through a template, held or pasted to the surface. Pictures of women in particular are often outlined thus with dots or crosses, but these are rarely seen on ships or whaling scenes, most of which seem to have been done freehand.<p /><p class="body">Surprisingly, a careful examination has revealed that most scrimshaw engravings were done with a very fine sharp blade. Occasionally a fine point was used but evidence of a graving tool is extremely rare. Sometimes a stipple of dots was used in places and a few designs were entirely stippled. Occasionally other marks such as deep pits or triangular picks are found, or some areas deeply cut away. This latter style was sometimes used by the scrimshaw artist Edward Burdett, who filled the interstices with red sealing wax.<p /><p class="body">The engraving was heightened by rubbing in pigment, usually black from soot or lamp-black and oil. Sometimes other colours were used in addition and referred to as polychrome. Red is the most common, on flags, to indicate the firing of cannon and as blood from injured whales. A greenish-blue, probably Prussian blue, is fairly common for flags and the sea. Women&#8217;s clothes were the most likely to be coloured, and green, brown, yellow and orange are also occasionally found. Ivory teeth were also cut up and carved into a variety of scrimshaw artefacts and used for inlays and sculpting teeth was a technique which became popular with Antarctic whalers in the 20th century.<p /><p class="body">The mandibles (lower jaw bones) of the great whales were also a popular scrimshaw material. This bone could be sawn, bent, polished, carved and engraved and so was fashioned into dozens of things from purely functional tools to engraved plaques and stay-busk (corset stays). Less commonly the mandibles of small toothed whales such as pilot whales/blackfish (Globicephala species) and various dolphins were decorated complete.<p /><p class="body">Increase extraction of mineral oils in the 20th century eventually reduced the demand for whale oil and the widespread production of scrimshaw ceased. With the introduction of hunting bans, populations of the great whales have finally begun to increase. However, despite bans on commercial whaling and the trade in whale products, Japan, Norway and Iceland still kill 2000 whales between them each year and also continue trade in whale products.</p>

					<p class="body">This pairing sets two pieces of scrimshaw, made from sperm whale teeth, alongside a mammoth tooth from the Woodwardian collection, the founding collection of the Sedgwick Museum.<p /><p class="body">The mammoth tooth takes us back to the time of the cabinet of curiosities or wunderkammer, the eccentric collections built up by individual collectors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which have formed the cornerstone of many modern collections and shaped the idea of the museum itself. The tooth, sent to John Woodward by a correspondent, was misidentified as belonging to a whale; it came in a package with other specimens presented as fragments of fossilized unicorn horn.<p /><p class="body">The two delicate pieces of scrimshaw depict Neptune and Britannia, and a whaling ship at sea. They were scribed by an anonymous hand in the mid&#8211;nineteenth century during idle hours in the course of a whaling voyage. Unlike the tooth they sit beside, they are genuinely whale teeth: only the tip of these horn-like forms would have protruded from the mouth of the sperm whale of which they were part. Since the 1960s, however, in large part due to President John F. Kennedy&#8217;s enthusiasm, the market for scrimshaw has led to big business in the production of fake examples, or &#8216;fakeshaw&#8217;. The teeth of recently caught whales can be decorated, stained and peddled as old; walrus teeth or plastic can likewise be engraved and passed off as the real thing.<p /><p class="body">The question of misidentification touches the history of both objects. They intersect in different ways with the notion of what makes something collectable &#8211; its scientific interest, its rarity (to the point of fictionality, in the case of unicorn horn) or the enthusiasm of one very famous public figure. Our desires for objects to be certain things, to fit in with collections we have made, govern how they enter the museum space &#8211; at times in error, or under false pretences &#8211; and can prompt us to reflect on the very impulses that draw us to museums and collections in the first place.<p/>

					<p class="body">The collection of geological specimens and fossils formed a key part of the research work of the Antarctic expeditions of the heroic age of polar exploration (1901&#8211;22). Dr Edward Wilson, Chief of Scientific Staff on Captain Scott&#8217;s British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition, 1910&#8211;13, was so committed to the importance of such specimens that he refused to offload from the sledge those he had collected on the journey to the South Pole, even when malnutrition and exhaustion were driving the men towards death. The specimens were retrieved when the bodies of Wilson, Scott and Henry &#8216;Birdie&#8217; Bowers were found.<p /><p class="body">During World War II, the Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History) (now the Natural History Museum) in London sent a number of the fossils picked up during the Terra Nova expedition to the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge. The following is a transcript of the correspondence with Walter Campbell-Smith, an authority on Antarctic fossils:<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">Letter from Walter Campbell-Smith (to the Professor of Geology, University of Cambridge) relating to the Terra Nova fossil specimens</span><p /><p class="body">29 September 1944<p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">I am instructed by the Trustees to send you a small selection of duplicates from the collections of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910&#8211;1913. These specimens now being despatched are from the Slate-Greywacke Formation of Robertson Bay, described in British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition, 1910, Natural History Report, Geology, Vol 1. No. 4, No 4b, dated 1921.</span><p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">You have already received representative specimens of the plutonic and metamorphic rocks collected by this expedition. A selection of the Volcanic rocks are being sent under separate cover and list is enclosed.</span><p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">It is possible that the specimens of plutonic and metamorphic rocks have been handed over to the Department of Mineralogy and Petrology. You will be quite free to hand over these specimens now sent, to the same Department if you wish to do so.</span><p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">Yours faithfully.<br />W.Campbell-Smith</span><p /><p class="body">Copy of Reply [presumably from Cecil Edgar Tilley?]<p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">Dear Sir<br />The Professor of Geology has handed over to me with your letter a selection of duplicates from the collections of the B.A.E, 1910&#8211;1913 which you forwarded to him on September 29th.</span><p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">The Department of Mineralogy and Petrology is most grateful to receive this collection which will be added to the Polar Collections which contain representative specimens of plutonic and metamorphic rocks collected by the British Antarctic Expedition.</span><p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">I am happy to note from your letter that Cambridge may receive later a set of volcanic rocks.</span><p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">Yours faithfully</span></p>

				data-description='Sanstone moraine. Working on fossil boulder. (Image© SPRI P54/16/218). Lieutenant Campbell writes (Feb 2): &#8216;We spent the forenoon breaking up a big boulder [arkose conglomerate], a longer job than we expected, as the lower half was embedded in the frozen soil. After digging it out and rolling it over, Priestley split it open. Inside was found a beautiful specimen of wood. Levick photographed it before we proceeded to break it up, as we knew we could never get it out whole.&#8217;'

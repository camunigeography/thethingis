					<p class="body">These two Antarctic rocks contain the fossilized remains of the leaves of <span class="italicise">Nothofagus</span>, or the southern beech. They are placed beside herbarium sheets for specimens of <span class="italicise">Nothofagus Antarctica</span> made in July 2014 in the Cambridge University Botanic Garden.<p /><p class="body">Today, not a single species of flowering plant survives on the Antarctic continent. Once, however, the landmass formed part of the temperate and biodiverse supercontinent Gondwanaland. Around 160 million years ago it broke up, forming what is now South America, Africa, Madagascar, Australia, the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian Peninsula, as well as Antarctica.<p /><p class="body">The landmass we now know as Antarctica drifted south and froze up. When explorers of the Heroic Age (1901&#8211;1922) began to discover and bring back fossils such as those exhibited here, little was understood about their origins. However, these specimens were vital evidence for the later theories of continental drift which govern our understanding today; identification of the fossil was only possible because of the work of modern botanists. By pooling resources from past and present, and across collections, museums can accelerate scientific progress.<p /><p class="body">Both objects are the result of different but comparable processes of preservation, one of which is accidental and one of which is deliberate. A fossil is created when organic material, such as a leaf, is buried in sediment; an imprint of its form remains as layers of sediment build up, are compressed into rock and the original material decays away. A herbarium sheet is produced by pressing plant specimens in order to dry them out and flatten them, preserving the original material for examination and research. Herbaria provide unparalleled resources into plant morphology, distribution and genetic diversity.<p/>

					<p class="body"><span class="bold">Odysseus Bust and Cherry-Garrard&#8217;s Diary</span><p /><p class="body">What was Odysseus doing in the Antarctic? His long journey from classical Greece to the polar diary of Apsley Cherry-Garrard demonstrates the hold that he has on our imagination, even at a distance of thousands of years and thousands of miles. Homer first told the story of Odysseus (also known by his Roman name, Ulysses) in the 8th century BC; in the 14th century, Dante placed Ulysses in the eighth circle of Hell in the <span class="italicise">Inferno</span>. Alfred Tennyson drew on both poets&#8217; versions of the myth when writing &#8216;Ulysses&#8217;, an elegy written in memory of his friend Arthur Hallam in 1833. Robert Falcon Scott was among the poem&#8217;s many readers: an extract was found copied into a volume of Browning&#8217;s poetry that was found with his body in November 1912. Cherry-Garrard transcribed the lines into his diary, and would later propose the poem&#8217;s final line – &#8216;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&#8217; – as an epitaph for Scott and the other members of the polar party.<p /><p class="body">Cherry-Garrard did not come upon the poem unprepared: he was highly familiar with the influences that underlaid it. He had been educated in the classical tradition as a public schoolboy (his fellow explorers joked that his knowledge of Latin and Greek would be indispensable on the expedition), and had read Dante&#8217;s <span class="italicise">Inferno</span> on the journey to the South Pole. He was also an avid reader of Tennyson – his copy of <span class="italicise">In Memoriam</span>, lent to his fellow explorer Edward Wilson, was found at the polar party&#8217;s final camp. <p /><p class="body">Although it presents an ambiguous portrait of its hero, Tennyson&#8217;s poem – especially its final line – has become iconic, a resolute statement of courage and fortitude. A section from the poem was read at the service in St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral commemorating the centenary of Scott&#8217;s death, while &#8216;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&#8217; was carved next to the entrance of the athlete&#8217;s village at the Olympic Games in 2012, aiming to inspire the competitors to greater efforts. Such uses of &#8216;Ulysses&#8217; is evidence that the myth of Odysseus still endures, richly imagined and re-imagined. <p /><p class="body"><br /><span class="bold">Books and the Heroic Age</span><p /><p class="body">&#8216;It has room for tools, books and lunch&#8217;, writes the car-proud heroine of <span class="italicise">The Lightning Conductor</span> (1902), a novel written by C.N. and A.M. Williamson and read by Apsley Cherry-Garrard on Robert Falcon Scott&#8217;s <span class="italicise">Terra Nova</span> expedition. Her praise for her Mercedes-Benz helpfully shows the place that reading might occupy on a journey: sandwiched between logistics and food, books were a practical necessity of travel.<p /><p class="body">This was especially true in the Antarctic. Books were a valuable resource for the explorers of the Heroic Age, whether they were sledging across vast ice-fields or confined to a hut for the long months of the polar winter. Each expedition brought an enormous variety of reading-matter, all of it helping its members to understand or cope with the unfamiliar continent in which they found themselves. &#8216;Books were naturally often discussed&#8217;, remembered one of the scientists on the <span class="italicise">Terra Nova</span>, and the exchange of books and recommendations was a useful way of staving off boredom. The officers on Scott&#8217;s <span class="italicise">Discovery</span> expedition debated the poetic achievements of Browning and Tennyson, and many explorers were avid readers of fiction: Dickens and Eliot were popular, as was Owen Wister&#8217;s cowboy novel <span class="italicise">The Virginian</span> (1902). Each expedition&#8217;s library would include accounts of previous Arctic and Antarctic voyages, which would be consulted for helpful tips on polar clothing and nutrition; ironically, these lavishly illustrated books were usually too large and too expensive to bring on a sledging journey.<p /><p class="body">This is not to say that reading did not have a direct effect on the way that the explorers interacted with the Antarctic landscape. One party named a newly discovered river the &#8216;Alph&#8217; in honour of Coleridge&#8217;s poem &#8220;Kubla Khan&#8221;, and many polar travellers would memorise poetry in order to have something to recite to themselves on their long trudges across the snows. Hundreds of miles from base camp and thousands of miles from home, books could provide vital sustenance. &#8216;Had two meals to&#8211;day, to save food,&#8217; wrote Shackleton on the <span class="italicise">Discovery</span> expedition, &#8216;so read some Darwin for lunch&#8217;.<p /><p class="body">Phil Sidney, 2014<p /><p class="body"><br /><span class="bold">Ulysses</span><p /><p class="body">It little profits that an idle king,<br />By this still hearth, among these barren crags,<br />Match&#8217;d with an aged wife, I mete and dole<br />Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br />That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.<br />I cannot rest from travel: I will drink<br />Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy&#8217;d<br />Greatly, have suffer&#8217;d greatly, both with those<br />That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when<br />Thro&#8217; scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br />Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;<br />For always roaming with a hungry heart<br />Much have I seen and known; cities of men<br />And manners, climates, councils, governments,<br />Myself not least, but honour&#8217;d of them all;<br />And drunk delight of battle with my peers,<br />Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.<br />I am a part of all that I have met;<br />Yet all experience is an arch wherethro&#8217;<br />Gleams that untravell&#8217;d world whose margin fades<br />For ever and forever when I move.<br />How dull it is to pause, to make an end,<br />To rust unburnish&#8217;d, not to shine in use!<br />As tho&#8217; to breathe were life! Life piled on life<br />Were all too little, and of one to me<br />Little remains: but every hour is saved<br />From that eternal silence, something more,<br />A bringer of new things; and vile it were<br />For some three suns to store and hoard myself,<br />And this gray spirit yearning in desire<br />To follow knowledge like a sinking star,<br />Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.<p /><p class="body">This is my son, mine own Telemachus,<br />To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,—<br />Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil<br />This labour, by slow prudence to make mild<br />A rugged people, and thro&#8217; soft degrees<br />Subdue them to the useful and the good.<br />Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere<br />Of common duties, decent not to fail<br />In offices of tenderness, and pay<br />Meet adoration to my household gods,<br />When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.<p /><p class="body">There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:<br />There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,<br />Souls that have toil&#8217;d, and wrought, and thought with me—<br />That ever with a frolic welcome took<br />The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed<br />Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;<br />Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;<br />Death closes all: but something ere the end,<br />Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br />Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.<br />The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:<br />The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep<br />Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,<br />&#8217;T is not too late to seek a newer world.<br />Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br />The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br />To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br />Of all the western stars, until I die.<br />It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br />It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br />And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br />Tho&#8217; much is taken, much abides; and tho&#8217;<br />We are not now that strength which in old days<br />Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;<br />One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br /> Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br />To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.<p /><p class="body">Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809&#8211;92)</p>

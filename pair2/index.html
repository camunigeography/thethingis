The latter work recounts his ten-year struggle to return home from the Trojan War. A complex figure, Odysseus has been demonized as a sly and calculating trickster and celebrated as an icon of endurance, ingenuity and heroic endeavour.<p /><p class="body">Cherry-Garrard&#8217;s journal sits alongside this cast, open at a page which quotes from Alfred Lord Tennyson&#8217;s poem &#8216;Ulysses&#8217;, in which Victorian England&#8217;s most celebrated poet dramatises this mythological figure in old age, bored after his return home, vowing to set out exploring until he dies. Cherry-Garrard quotes the last line, &#8216;To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield,&#8217; after learning of the death of the five men who had gone to the South Pole: Captain Scott, Dr Edward Wilson, Lt Henry &#8216;Birdie&#8217; Bowers, Captain Lawrence Oates and Petty Officer Edgar Evans. It was also the inscription chosen for the cross erected to their memory on Observation Hill, at the southern tip of Ross Island in Antarctica.<p /><p class="body">Tennyson&#8217;s poem, and particularly the last line, expresses an ideal of courage and determination which suited both the expedition members&#8217; dedication to scientific enquiry &#8211; seeking and finding &#8211; and a classical vision of heroic manhood, embodied in mythological figures such as Odysseus/Ulysses, which motivated the explorers of what is often called the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration. It was essential for Cherry-Garrard and the other survivors to feel that the tragedy of the death of Scott and his companions had not been meaningless: Tennyson&#8217;s &#8216;Ulysses&#8217; expressed the values for which they died.<p/>

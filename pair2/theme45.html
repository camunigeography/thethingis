					<p class="body">Apsley George Benet Cherry-Garrard was born in Bedford on 2 January 1886. He was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. Despite being hampered by poor eyesight he was, on Edward Adrian Wilson&#8217;s recommendation, selected as assistant zoologist for the British Antarctic &#8216;Terra Nova&#8217; Expedition, 1910&#8211;1913, led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott. Spending two years at Cape Evans, he edited the expedition newspaper <span class="italicise">The South Polar Times</span> and took part in all the major sledging activities, including the winter journey in 1911, with Wilson and Henry Robertson &#8216;Birdie&#8217; Bowers, to Cape Crozier to collect emperor penguin eggs. As part of the support team, he accompanied Scott and the pole party as far as the upper depot on the Beardmore Glacier in December 1911. In March 1912, he reached One Ton Depot, accompanied by Russian dog-driver, Dmitriy Gerov. This sledging journey was carrying supplies for the returning polar party, but was unable to stay longer than six days due to a lack of dog food and concern for Gerov&#8217;s deteriorating health. Cherry-Garrard was to regret the decision to return to base for the rest of his life. At the time he turned back, Scott&#8217;s party was just 60 miles further south, something Cherry-Garrard had no means of knowing. When Scott failed to reach Cape Evans, it was clear that he and all those with him had died. Cherry-Garrard was a member of the search party, led by Edward Atkinson, which found and buried the bodies of Scott, Wilson and Bowers in November 1912.<p /><p class="body">After serving in the First World War, Cherry-Garrard was invalided out in 1915 and returned to the family home, Lamer Park, near Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire. Here he began to write his classic account of the expedition, <span class="italicise">The Worst Journey in the World</span> (first published in 1922), often discussing passages and problems of composition with his neigbour George Bernard Shaw. He took up book collecting and contributed to several publications. In his later years, he suffered from bouts of depression and ill health and, in 1947, was forced to sell Lamer Park. He died in London on 18 May 1959.</p>

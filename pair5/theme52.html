					<h3 class="black">Dr Edward Adrian Wilson (1872&#8211;1912)</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					<p class="body">Born in Cheltenham, the second son of a local physician, Wilson came to Cambridge as an undergraduate reading Natural Sciences. His college rooms were reported to be littered with drawings and the bones and skulls of numerous birds. Self-taught, his sketching nevertheless developed well, aligned with his passion for ornithology. Wilson was assistant surgeon, artist and vertebrate zoologist on Captain Scott&#8217;s Discovery expedition, 1901&#8211;04, and his remarkable drawings and paintings of the Antarctic landscape are without equal. A deeply religious man, his sympathetic character and genuine care for his shipmates made him one of the most admired on the voyage.<p /><p class="body">On the return of Discovery, an exhibition of Wilson&#8217;s pictures was held at the Bruton Gallery, London. Wilson was one of the first men to &#8216;convey an accurate idea of the beauty and subtlety of Antarctic colours. Often these records were as precise as photography and much more pleasing&#8217;. Among the throng of viewers was Sir Joseph Hooker, then aged 88, who as a young naturalist had accompanied Sir James Clark Ross to Antarctica over 60 years before. &#8216;I made an effort to see the Antarctic sketches&#8217;, he remarked, &#8216;they are marvellous in number, interest and execution. No naval expedition ever did the like. The heads and bodies of the birds by Dr Wilson are the perfection of ornithological drawing and colouring. They are absolutely alive&#8217;.<p /><p class="body">He was for some time appointed Field Observer to the Grouse Disease Inquiry and illustrated wildlife books. In 1910 he returned to the Antarctic with Captain Scott, joining Terra Nova as expeditionary artist, zoologist and Chief of the Scientific Staff. Wilson was an automatic choice as a member of the final South Pole party and he died alongside Scott on the return journey in 1912. At the last, Scott wrote of him: &#8216;He died, as he lived, a brave, true man &#8211; the best of comrades and staunchest of friends&#8217;. In the years that followed, a great number of Wilson&#8217;s watercolours and sketches were given to the newly-established Scott Polar Research Institute, where they now form a suitable tribute to his artistic legacy.</p>

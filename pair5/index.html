					<p class="body">Two skyscapes by Edward Adrian Wilson from 1901 are seen here alongside one from the Fitzwilliam Museum by Thomas Kerrich, painted around a hundred years earlier.<p /><p class="body">Kerrich was the Cambridge University librarian (Protobibliothecarius), a clergyman and antiquary who died in 1828; Wilson was a medical doctor and zoologist who died with Captain Robert Falcon Scott in 1912, returning from the South Pole. Both men were gifted amateur artists and the similarity of their skyscapes is remarkable.<p /><p class="body">Despite the likeness, these paintings come from different points in a long tradition of painting the sky. They bear witness to the importance of painting as part of the life of a certain class of cultured, English gentleman from the eighteenth century until the early twentieth century. In a period before the existence of photography but well after the development of the idea of the picturesque in the late 1600s and early 1700s, painting the land and sky was a way both to demonstrate technique and taste, and to record the natural world.<p /><p class="body">Kerrich is probably painting somewhere in East Anglia: he doesn&#8217;t record where or when. We know that Wilson is painting in the Southern Indian and Southern Oceans as he notes the place and date below the paintings. While both men painted for pleasure, Kerrich feels no need to record anything about the image he has made. For Wilson, however, who also produced meticulous paintings and sketches of zoological specimens, the habit of recording and cataloguing was part of his scientific training. This skyscape is part of a series of works which form a comprehensive visual document of Scott&#8217;s Discovery expedition, 1901&#8211;04. Without the details Wilson provides, however, there is little (save the sea) to tell the locations apart either in space or time.<p/>

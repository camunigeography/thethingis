					<p class="body"><span class="bold">History of the house</span><p /><p class="body">Pound Hill, Cambridge<p /><p class="body">Kettle&#8217;s Yard was originally conceived with students in mind. In 1954 Jim Ede envisaged creating &#8216;a living place where works of art could be enjoyed . . . where young people could be at home unhampered by the greater austerity of the museum or public art gallery.&#8217;<p /><p class="body">In 1956 Jim and Helen came to Cambridge in search of a &#8216;stately home&#8217;. What they found instead were four tumbledown cottages nestling beneath the ancient church of St Peter. With the help of architect Roland Aldridge, Ede restored and substantially remodelled them.<br />Jim Ede kept &#8217;open house&#8217; every afternoon of term, personally guiding his visitors around his home. In 1966 he gave the house and its contents to the University of Cambridge. In 1970, three years before the Edes retired to Edinburgh, the house was extended, and an exhibition gallery added, both to the design of the architects Sir Leslie Martin and David Owers.<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">Kettle&#8217;s Yard</span><p /><p class="body">Between 1958 and 1973 Kettle&#8217;s Yard was the home of Jim and Helen Ede. In the 1920s and 30s Jim had been a curator at the Tate Gallery in London. Thanks to his friendships with artists and other like-minded people, over the years he gathered a remarkable collection, including paintings by Ben and Winifred Nicholson, Alfred Wallis, Christopher Wood, David Jones and Joan Miro, as well as sculptures by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Constantin Brancusi, Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth.<p /><p class="body">At Kettle&#8217;s Yard Jim carefully positioned these artworks alongside furniture, glass, ceramics and natural objects, with the aim of creating a harmonic whole. His vision was of a place that should not be "an art gallery or museum, nor ... simply a collection of works of art reflecting my taste or the taste of a given period. It is, rather, a continuing way of life from these last fifty years, in which stray objects, stones, glass, pictures, sculpture, in light and in space, have been used to make manifest the underlying stability."<p /><p class="body">Kettle&#8217;s Yard was originally conceived with students in mind. Jim kept &#8216;open house&#8217; every afternoon of term, personally guiding visitors around his home. In 1966 he gave the house and its contents to the University of Cambridge. In 1970, three years before the Edes retired to Edinburgh, the house was extended, and an exhibition gallery added.<p /><p class="body">Today, each afternoon (apart from Mondays) visitors can ring the bell and ask to look around.<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">The permanent Collection</span><p /><p class="body">Ede often described himself as a &#8216;friend of artists&#8217;, and much of his collection was acquired over five decades through these friendships. Moreover, in 1927 Jim purchased a substantial body of works by the French sculptor, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who had been killed in World War I: &#8216;A great quantity of his work was dumped in my office at the Tate.&#8217; Soon after, Nicholson and Wood introduced Ede to the work of St Ives fisherman-turned-painter Alfred Wallis. In the following decade he and Wallis exchanged numerous letters (some preserved in the Archive), and Jim acquired over one hundred of the artist&#8217;s paintings and drawings.<p /><p class="body">During the years he and Helen spent abroad (1936&#8211;56), Jim did not acquire new work. However, once in Cambridge he actively resumed collecting. It was at this point that he became interested in new artists, including William Congdon, Italo Valenti and Elisabeth Vellacott.<p /><p class="body">Given the care devoted by Jim to the display of objects and artworks and to creating subtle &#8217;conversations&#8217; between them, since his departure the house has been preserved virtually unchanged. Today many consider it a work of art in its own right.</p>

					<h3 class="black">Constantin Brancusi at Kettle&#8217;s Yard</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					<p class="body">The collection at Kettle&#8217;s yard contains 2 drawings, one of which is displayed, 3 photographs and 2 sculptures, both of which are displayed.<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">Oiseau dans l&#8217;espace (Bird in Space)</span>, 1926&#8211;27<p /><p class="body">Brancusi was famously dissatisfied with photographs of his works taken by anyone other than himself. This in spite of the fact that his sculptures were at different times photographed by masters of the medium such as Man Ray, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen.<p /><p class="body">The main reason behind this diffidence seems to be Brancusi&#8217;s use of photography as an integral part to his creative process. In his relentless search for formal purity, the sculptor used photographs as the means to control the positioning and lighting of the works, thus fixing an &#8216;ideal&#8217; view for them. Once he felt he had achieved formal perfection in three dimensions through sculpture, photography allowed him to gain control over the fourth dimension, time. It could be argued, from this point of view, that Brancusi&#8217;s photographs represent the culmination of his artistic research, paradoxically, for a sculptor, in two dimensions.<p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">Oiseau dans l&#8217;espace</span> belongs in a group of works exploring the theme of birds and flight, which had its beginnings around 1911 with Maiastra. The Bird in Space series spanned between 1924 and 1941. It saw a progressive development in the direction of verticality (achieved by increasing height and decreasing depth of the work) and de-materialisation of the figure, suggested by the use of light over reflecting surfaces (an aspect particularly highlighted by the photographs). The measurement inscribed on the verso of the Kettle&#8217;s Yard image (53 inches) suggests that this is one of the two versions in polished bronze of the work, made in 1926 and 1927.<p /><p class="body">This photograph was most likely a gift from the artist to H.S. Ede, circa 1934.<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">Prometheus</span><p /><p class="body">Constantin Brancusi established the main themes of his art at a relatively early stage and persisted in their refinement and development in the remainder of his career. Prometheus lies in a sequence of works dealing with recumbent, isolated heads. The majority of these revolve around the apparently contrasting subjects of sleep and torment, two themes which the sculptor often attempted to balance in his work.<p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">Prometheus</span>, in Greek mythology one of the Titans and god of fire, tricked Zeus, the chief god, into accepting the bones and fat of sacrifice instead of the meat. When Zeus hid fire from man to punish him, Prometheus stole it and returned it to Earth once again. As punishment, Zeus had him chained to a rock and sent an eagle to eat his liver, which constantly replenished itself. In Brancusi&#8217;s interpretation of Prometheus&#8217; tragic fate, the head &#8211; apparently a portrait of an actual boy &#8211; is inclined in a gesture that suggests both pain and eternal rest. The title may also refer to Prometheus as the original artist, the creator defiant of the Gods, an idea which had been taken up by the German Romantics and was familiar to Brancusi.<p /><p class="body">The cement cast at Kettle&#8217;s Yard was made from the marble original of 1911. It is one of several versions in different materials. The features of the head barely emerge from the cement. The smooth surface is offset by the reflections cast in the lid of the piano. This gives the viewer a real sense of the volume of the object. Yet, in a characteristic combination of contrasting visual effects recurrent throughout the house, Jim Ede&#8217;s choice of placing the sculpture on the piano makes it also appear as if it is floating, creating a remarkable tension between weight and lightness.<p /><p class="body">This gift was from the artist to Vera Moore, in the 1930s, H. S. Ede purchased it from Vera Moore in 1969 (having been on loan to Kettle&#8217;s Yard from 1967).<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">Nude</span><p /><p class="body">Brancusi&#8217;s preferred method for developing sculptural ideas was modelling in clay and plaster. He rarely sketched or made studies on paper, so drawings by him are quite rare. Of the drawings which exist, it is often not clear whether they were made before or after the sculptures they refer to. These factors have contributed to a common difficulty to date the sculptor&#8217;s works on paper. Nude could have been made at any time between 1906 and 1926, when Brancusi gave it to Jim Ede.<p /><p class="body">The drawing bears some resemblance with Brancusi&#8217;s sculptural fragment <span class="italicise">Torso</span> of 1908&#8211;09, which shows the side, hip and upper thigh of a young woman in a similar leaning pose. <span class="italicise">Torso</span> is a small work, probably extracted from the central section of an earlier sculpture, <span class="italicise">The Prayer</span>. The formal likeness of the Kettle&#8217;s Yard drawing with these sculptures suggests that it might date from around 1907&#8211;09. However, Brancusi worked again on the theme of the torso during the following decade, notably in 1912 and 1918, so the drawing might be later.<p /><p class="body">The ease and dexterity of the line make this a remarkable work. It may be compared favourably with a few related &#8211; and also undated &#8211; works executed with the same economy of line and simplification of detail, especially a much larger Nude in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.<p /><p class="body">It is thought to be a gift from the artist to H.S. Ede, c.1926.<p /><p class="body"><span class="bold">Letter with sketches of &#8217;The Kiss&#8217;</span><p /><p class="body">The letter reads:<p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">Mon cher Ede,<br />Je vous remerci pour la plus belle fleur et d&#8217;une autre part je vous dois un mot en reponse a votre charmante lettre a la suit de votre dernier visite &#8211; J&#8217;explique a Vera que je voulé faire une poeme en reponse &#8211; et voila! le montagne a acouché d&#8217;une surir [sic (souris)]<br />Je vous envoyé [sic] par Vera un catalog de mon exposition a New York Il paré [sic (parait)] que c&#8217;est un succes apres ce qu&#8217;on dit, mais J&#8217;ai eu beaucoup du mal pour le faire et de l&#8217;avoir fait<br />Bon noèl aussi et je vous embrasse tous les deux et de tout coeur<br />Brancusi<br />Je vous enverai aussi des photos &#8211; il me samblé [sic] que vous les avez toutes</span><p /><p class="body"><span class="italicise">[My dear Ede,<br />I&#8217;m writing to thank you for the beautiful flower and to answer your charming letter after your last visit – I told Vera that I wanted to write a poem in response – and here we are! a whole faff for nothing.<br />I sent you via Vera a catalogue of my exhibition in New York. It seems that it&#8217;s a success from what they say but it cost me a lot of trouble to do it and get it finished.<br />Happy Christmas as well and I send you both a kiss with all my heart<br />Brancusi<br />I&#8217;ll also send you some photos – it seems to me they are all here]</span></p>

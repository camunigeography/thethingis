					<p class="body">The camera used to take pictures of the Örnen expedition was very up-to-date in 1897, because it used film rolls rather than glass plates to capture images. Rolled film made from cellulose nitrate was only invented in 1887 and the patent for it was not even granted until a year after the Örnen expedition disaster, although Eastman Kodak had been producing the film for some years by then. The advantages of rolled film on a balloon expedition are obvious, since film rolls are much smaller, lighter and more robust than large glass plates. However, cellulose nitrate film is also an explosive, and can even burn underwater. Large fires in cellulose nitrate movie film caused many deaths in the early 20th century, so by the 1950s this type of film had been replaced with cellulose acetate safety film.<p /><p class="body">Cellulose nitrate negatives are still found in museums, where they continue to pose a fire risk. Another problem is that cellulose nitrate negatives break down quite quickly over time, with the image gradually being lost. Storing these negatives in a freezer almost completely stops this process, as well as hugely reducing the fire risk, so nowadays we keep this type of film below 0⁰C. It is a curious coincidence that the dry and freezing conditions on Kvitøya where Andree, Strindberg and Fraenkel died should have been almost perfect for preserving the film record of their doomed expedition.<p /><p class="body">Sophie Rowe, Conservator, The Polar Museum</p>

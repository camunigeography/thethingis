					<p class="body">A photograph of Salomon August Andrée&#8217;s hot air balloon, Örnen (The Eagle), shortly after it crashed in 1897 is paired here with a photograph of Constantin Brancusi&#8217;s sculpture &#8216;Bird in Space&#8217;, taken by the sculptor himself around 1926. These two images, both black and white, both strangely abstract, invite consideration of photography as art and as historic record.<p /><p class="body">Brancusi (1874&#8211;1957) was a Romanian sculptor who briefly studied under Rodin when he first arrived in Paris in 1903. Andrée (1854&#8211;1897) was a Swedish aeronaut who attempted, and failed, to reach the North Pole in a hot air balloon in 1897. Both men were intensely interested in flight and would pursue it in different ways throughout their careers.<p /><p class="body">Brancusi&#8217;s style of sculpture was modernist, although he resisted being labelled abstract, despite an increasing move toward reductionist methods in his work. He was particularly interested in capturing the essence, or spirit, of things (birds, fish, women) rather than merely representing their discernable forms. Andrée was first and foremost a scientist who had little time for art or literature, although he was very interested in phrenology (measurements of the human skull). He was determined to be the first to reach the North Pole in a hot air balloon, despite serious misgivings from those around him regarding the balloon&#8217;s safety and the feasibility of such an attempt. Neither man married and both of them displayed a dogged determination to capture an experience of flight.<p /><p class="body">The fêted photographer and friend of Brancusi&#8217;s, Man Ray, bought him his first camera and helped him to create a dark room in his studio. After this, Brancusi never allowed anyone else to photograph his sculptures, insisting on complete control over how his works should be seen. He was considered a competent photographer rather than a talented one during his lifetime, due to his often sloppy processing or the clutter in the background of some of his shots, which actually reveals much about his working life.<p /><p class="body">Andrée was fastidious about documenting his attempt to reach the North Pole. Not only did he keep a diary, but he also invited the talented young photographer, Nils Strindberg, to be the official expedition photographer. The men would die together, along with their crew mate Knut Fraenkel, on White Island in the Svalbard archipelago after surviving for more than two months on drifting pack ice. Their remains were found by the crew of a whaling ship 33 years later; both the diary and the camera along with five rolls of exposed film, were found near their bodies. Ninety-three of the photographs were saved and are now on display at the Gränna museum in Sweden.<p/>

					<p class="body"><span class="bold">English, made by William Wilton, c. 1830</span><p /><p class="body">A dip circle is used to measure the angle between the horizon and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field (the dip angle or &#8216;magnetic dip&#8217;). The instrument served a practical use in surveying, mining and prospecting through the measurement of local variations in magnetic field. <p /><p class="body">The Fox-type was designed by Cornish industrialist, geologist, and physicist Robert Were Fox (1789&#8211;1877) and first set out in print in 1834. Fox&#8217;s design emerged from experiments into terrestrial magnetism in Cornish mines. Changes in magnetic dip also had practical value in the field of navigation, and in the 1840s the Fox-type became the standard instrument for Admiralty observations of dip at sea. The design was widely recommended for its stability and portability. Fox worked with a number of instrument makers but encouraged the production and development of his instrument by Cornish makers such as William Wilton &#8211; to the frustration of those outside Cornwall, keen to commission an instrument. Fox placed particular emphasis on balancing the needles himself. <p /><p class="body">This instrument&#8217;s maker, William Wilton (1801&#8211;1860), established in St Day, Cornwall in the 1830s and specialised in adapting mathematical instruments for use in mines. Fox was among the judges of a series of Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society panels which awarded Wilton prizes for the quality of his work through the 1830s. From 1845 Fox and Wilton worked together on the Fox-type design, Fox describing Wilton as &#8216;ingenious&#8217; and Wilton&#8217;s work &#8216;even beyond [his] expectations&#8217;. A Wilton Fox-type was exhibited at the 1851 Great Exhibition alongside mine-surveying instruments by the same maker. Despite Wilton&#8217;s parochial location in the little town of St Day, his mining instruments can be found all over the world following in the wake of Cornish émigré miners and Admiralty navigators.<p /><p class="body">As B.H. Brough&#8217;s 1894 Treatise on Mine-Surveying noted, &#8220;…the uninitiated are apt to believe that the operator must be specially gifted; and frequently the supernatural properties formerly ascribed to the divining-rod are transferred to the [dip circle].&#8221; The mysterious quality of magnetism together with the practical use of the dip in prospecting was even exploited by con-men: &#8220;a powerful magnet inserted in a walking-stick has been successfully employed to give a large dip to the needle when it was thought desirable to mislead the purchaser.&#8221;<p /><p class="body">Dip Circles were also used to map the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, and they were key instruments on some of the greatest explorations of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. On 1 June 1831, the British naval officer and explorer James Clark Ross used a dip circle to accurately locate the position of the North Magnetic Pole on the Boothia Peninsula in the far north of Canada. In 1844 the diarist Caroline Fox wrote of a young naval officer having his dip circle returned to him: &#8220;He had greatly distressed himself at missing the square box containing &#8216;his darling child&#8217;, as he called [it], which he said had never before been separated from him during fifty thousand miles of travels&#8221;.<p /><p class="body">Jenny Bulstrode, Part III student in History and Philosophy of Science and Josh Nall, Assistant Curator, Whipple Museum of the History of Science.</p>

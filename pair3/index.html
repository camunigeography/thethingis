					<p class="body">A makeshift sun compass used by Dr Edward Adrian Wilson on the British National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition, 1901&#8211;04, led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott, sits beside a Fox-type dip circle from the Whipple Museum of the History of Science. What links the cast of a head of Odysseus and this page of manuscript from Apsley Cherry-Garrard&#8217;s journal, written during Captain Robert Falcon Scott&#8217;s British Antarctic Expedition of 1910&#8211;13?<p /><p class="body">A dip circle measures the difference between the horizon and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. It is useful in surveying, mining and prospecting, as well as in the demonstration and study of magnetism. Refinements to its design made by Robert Were Fox (1789&#8211;1877), a Cornish industrialist, geologist and physicist, made it an indispensable tool in polar navigation, allowing for much more accurate readings of the magnetic poles.<p /><p class="body">It was not used, however, in navigating to the geographic poles, an endeavour which rendered traditional magnetic compasses useless, since the pull of the earth&#8217;s magnetic poles scrambles the needle. A sun compass is a useful tool for the polar navigator, as it is unaffected by the earth&#8217;s magnetic field in the approach to the pole. Aligning the shadow of the pointer (gnomon) with the correct time on the dial allows you to work out the meridian.<p /><p class="body">The two instruments side by side embody polar opposites of simplicity and complexity in the design of scientific equipment, the sun compass made in the field in harsh Antarctic conditions, the dip circle carefully assembled in the workshop of William Wilton (1801&#8211;60) in the small Cornish town of St Day. They prompt us to reflect on what happens to objects which once had a very specific function when they are placed in a museum, no longer used for the purpose for which they were designed. How do we then engage with them? Do they simply become aesthetic attractions, most interesting for their sculptural qualities?<p/>
